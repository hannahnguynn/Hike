# Hike
During quarantine, my fellow peers and I developed a program that replicated Disney's park reservation system. Instead, we applied it to National Parks in hopes of reducing days of overconcentration and stopping the spread. Users are able to choose make, view, and cancel their reservations, containing information regarding the date and time of their visit, their desired park, the size of their party.

- Collaborated with a group of peers to implement a user-friendly interface with menu-driven interactions, allowing users to view trail details, check availability, input personal information, and confirm reservations seamlessly to prevent high concentrations of visitors during the pandemic.
- Utilized data structures like linked lists and arrays to store trail information, reservation records, and availability status, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for users and administrators.
- Integrated date and time handling functionalities to prevent conflicting reservations, enabling users to book hikes without overlaps and providing clear notifications for fully booked trails.
