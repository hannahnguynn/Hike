# Hike
During quarantine, my fellow peers and I developed a program that replicated Disney's park reservation system. Instead, we applied it to National Parks in hopes of reducing days of overconcentration and stopping the spread. Users are able to choose make, view, and cancel their reservations, containing information regarding the date and time of their visit, their desired park, the size of their party.

Skills used to complete program:
- object orientated programming
- linked lists
- data allocation using pointers, maps, multimaps, sets, etc.
- ifstream files
- user interface with thorough error handling
